# Euterpe

Fully featured AudioContext music player for the web, written in Rust.

## Euterpe in production:

- Hypertrance ( [site](https://hypertrance.eu/), [repository](https://github.com/nuphory/hypertrance.eu) )

Features:

- "Local" library/database for songs, collections, artists, waveforms, artist links and much more!
- Queue and history
- Easy way to create Vector based audio visuals
- Library automatization based on folder/file structure, preprocessing and encoding media files for all platforms
- Safe. Provides wrappers for all functions that are either unsafe or don't give a success return. (very Rust inspired, yes.)
- Frontend library agnostic
